Features

	Avg of the last x seconds (x=60 default)

	- blink rate per minute
	- length of blink (# of frames (time) when eye is closed) 
	- yawning rate per minute
	- length of yawn (time or frames)
	- 

	NODDING
		Look at location of pupil
		Identify a nod:
			//Figure out amplitude and frequency (y axis) of the eye movement 
			Max, Min position (y) in the last 10 seconds

	====

	create functions
		- eyes_closed() -> returns boolean 1/0
		- find_mouth() -> returns boolean 1/0

		some function figures out blink rate and yawn rate by calling the two functions every frame and keeping track of time

		MAX/MIN -> for nodding. Use a linked list of some sort
			data structure -> add a max/min element to it

		- nose detection -> to detect center of face
			always look into center of face rectangle 

	====

	performance improvement

		- cut out the face
		- use b/w instead of color
		- eye detection: restrict to top of the fae (only identifies one)
		- mouth detection: restrict to bottom half of face
		- look at using different resolutions and speed vs accuracy?
		- parallelize to use 4 cores

		- option: capture 4 frames, parallelize and bring it back
